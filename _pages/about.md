My name is Xuanjun Chen(陈炫均). I am currently a research assistant in Multimedia Information Retrieval Lab, National Taiwan University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Jyh-Shing Roger Jang](http://mirlab.org/jang/cv/cv.asp).

I am also a first-year M.S. student in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at the [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). Before coming to NTU, I received my B.S. degree in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering from the [National Taiwan University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntust.edu.tw) in 2020.
My main research interest revolves around making machines that can understand human language. And I have recently been engaged in speech processing using Machine Learning (especially deep learning).
