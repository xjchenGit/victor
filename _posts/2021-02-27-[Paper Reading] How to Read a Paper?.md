How to reading paper!
=====

# 1. Introduction
This note is an excerpt from the [How to Read a Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) written by S.Keshav.

# 2. The three-pass approach

## 2.1 The first pass
The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird's eye view of the paper. You can also decide whether you need to do any more passes. This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
3.  Read the conclusions
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the one you've already read.

**Purpose:** At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs:

1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? 
2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. Contributions: What are the paper's main contributions?
5. Clarity: Is the paper well written?

## 2.2 The second pass
In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. It helps to jot down the key points or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams, and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

2. Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

**Purpose:** You should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else. This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested but does not lie in your research specialty.

**Other:** Sometimes you won't understand a paper even at the end of the second pass.
You can now choose to:

+ set the paper aside, hoping you don't need to understand the material to be successful in your career.
+ return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or persevere and go on to the third pass.

## 2.3 The third pass

The key to the third pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper: that is make the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper's innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

This pass requires great attention to detail. You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends
a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.

This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader. At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

# 3. Doing a literature survey

Paper reading skills are put to the test in doing a literature survey. This will require you to read tens of papers, perhaps in an unfamiliar field. What papers should you read? Here is how you can use the three-pass approach to help.

1. Use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to **five recent papers** in the area. Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work then read their related work sections. You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent survey paper if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper. If you can find such a survey, you are done. Read the survey, congratulating yourself on your good luck.
2. Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are the key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they've published recently. That will help you identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences. 
3. Go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.
